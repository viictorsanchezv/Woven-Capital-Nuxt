        <p class="mb-4 text-small">
          We collect your personal information as a data controller when we have
          a legal basis to do so. The following legal bases pertain to our
          collection of data:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li class="text-small">
            performance of a contract – any use of your personal information
            required to perform our services in accordance with the Terms of Use
            or any other legal agreement we enter into with you;
          </li>
          <li class="text-small">
            legal obligation – any use of your personal information required to
            comply with an applicable legal obligation, e.g., carrying out any
            identity authentication or background checks required by law;
          </li>
          <li class="text-small">
            consent – where required by law, we may obtain your prior consent

          <li class="text-small">
            legitimate interests – any use of your personal information not
            covered by the above bases is likely to be based on our legitimate
            business interests, provided these are not outweighed by your rights
            and interests. For example, we rely on our legitimate interest in
            understanding our Site audience and improving our Services to carry

          certain exemptions, and in some cases dependent upon the processing
          activity we are undertaking, when we act as a data controller,
          individuals in the European Union and United Kingdom have certain
          rights in relation to their personal information:

          >
          You have the right to request access to the personal information that
          we hold about you and: (a) the source of your personal information;
          (b) the purposes, legal basis and methods of processing; (c) the data
          controller’s identity; and (d) the entities or categories of entities
          to whom your personal information may be transferred.

        <p class="mb-4 text-small">
          We are not required to comply with your request to erase personal
          information if the processing of your personal information is
          necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the
          establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
        </p>

          unlawful but you do not want us to erase the data; (iii) we no longer
          need the personal information for the relevant purposes, but we
          require it for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal
          claims; or (iv) you have objected to our personal information use
          where such use is justified on our legitimate interests and we must
          verify as to whether we have a compelling interest to continue to use
          your data.

        <p class="mb-4 text-small">
          We can continue to use your personal information following a request

          used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it transferred
          directly to another data controller.

        <p class="mb-4 text-small">
          We may not always be able to fully address your request, for example

          We are based in Japan and the United States and you understand that
          any personal information you provide to us will be processed in Japan
          and the United States, as necessary to provide you with the Services
          and access to the Site. Data protection laws in the United States are
          not regarded as equivalent to those in the European Economic Area
          (EEA) or United Kingdom. We also may subcontract the processing of
          your information to, or otherwise share your personal information
          with, other parties in the United States or countries other than your
          country of residence.

        <p class="mb-5">
          As a result, where the personal information that we collect is
          transferred to and processed in Japan, the United States or anywhere
          else outside the EEA or UK for the purposes described above, we will
          take any steps required by law to ensure that the information receives
          the same level of protection as if it remained within the EEA or
          United Kingdom, including entering into data transfer agreements using
          the EU Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses or other
          mechanisms that provide an adequate level of protection for your
          personal information. You may have a right to details of the
          mechanisms under which your data is transferred outside the EEA or
          United Kingdom.
